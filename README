What is this?
=============
This is an apml parser written in python.
The doc will follow soon, I promise.
Until then, take a look at testapml.py 
test program to get the main idea of the 
project :)

Thanks:
==============
Many thanks go to these nice folks:

- Wai Yip Tung (http://tungwaiyip.info) who generously granted 
permission to include his "xml2obj" function (toolbox.py) 
in this work

- Mark Pilgrim (http://diveintomark.com) who wrote the 
the amazing "Dive into Python" in which the "openAnything" 
function (toolbox.py) was included and offered under the 
Python Licence.



See you soon with a more detailed version of this file!
